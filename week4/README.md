# Week 4: Multithreading & HTTP

## `Tuesday`
1. What is multi-threading?
    + Handling multiple threads / paths of execution in your program.

2. In what ways can you create a thread?
   + By extending the Thread Class or by implementing the `Runnable` Interface. You must call Thread's `.start()` method to start it as a new thread of execution.

3. Lifecycle of a thread
    + When created, in NEW state.
    + When `.start()` is called, it goes to RUNNABLE state.
    + When `.run()` is called, goes to RUNNING state.
    + If `.sleep()` or `.wait()` is called, will go to WAITING.
    + If dependent on another thread to release a lock, it will go to BLOCKED state.
    + When finished executing, will be in DEAD state and cannot be restarted.

4. What is deadlock?
    + When two or more threads are waiting on locks held by the others, such that no thread can execute

5. What is synchronized keyword?
    + Only allowing one thread access to the method or variable at a time - enforces thread-safety
