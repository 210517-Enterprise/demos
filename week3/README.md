# Week 3: Java SE API's

## `Friday`
To prep for Monday:
- Complete [this Hackerrank Problem](https://www.hackerrank.com/210570-enterprise-hr2) and walk me through your solution on Monday.
- Study SQL, AWS, and Java SE API's (think `Reflection`, `Stream API`, `Collection` Class implementations, `Optional` class).
- Research how to build your own `ORM`. (This will be your next project which is assigned on either Monday or Tuesday).'

## `Thursday`
- :star: Remember that the [20 Java Problems](https://classroom.github.com/a/DNzxX6Hm) are due tomorrow. ðŸ•™
- :star: If you haven't attempted yet, please try completing the custom [ArrayList, MergeSort, and BubbleSort Challenge](https://classroom.github.com/a/6-0WFWWc) (It has a list of resources to time complexity)
- :star: Watch: [Breadth First Search](https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/algorithms/graphs/breadth-first-search/tutorial/) and read through [this code](https://github.com/williamfiset/Algorithms/blob/master/src/main/java/com/williamfiset/algorithms/graphtheory/BreadthFirstSearchRecursive.java) -- *it helps to rewrite it in your IDE to familiarize yourself with the concept*. 
- Collections: Set, Maps, Queue
- Hash Functions
- Map Sorting
- Channel
- Buffer
- Java Date and Time API
