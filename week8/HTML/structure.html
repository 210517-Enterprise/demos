<!--
    HTML stands for hyper-text markup language. It's used to strcuture content on a webpage.
-->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<!-- 
        The DOCTYPE directive must be the very first non-comment line
        declared within our HTML documents (even before the <html> tag).
        It is not a tag, it is a directive, or instructon to the browser
        about what version of HTML the page is written in.
    -->
<html>
<!-- This is where our html code goes-->

<head>
    <!--
            <head>
                contains information about the page, rather than the information shown.
                We can include some information within the head such as:

                - <style> tag to apply internal CSS styling to the webpage
                - <link> tag for making use of an external resource (external CSS)
                - <script> tag for making use of JavaScript, which makes our webpages more dynamic
                - <meta> tag for including meta-informmation about the content of the page -- used more for SEO purposes
                - <title> tag for the title of the webpage.

</head>

<body>
    <!--
            <body>
                Contains info/content that will be displayed to the user,
                when rendered by the browser

                 ctrl + a will highlight , and alt + shift + f will auto format

    <h1>This is a main heading</h1>
    <h2>This is a subheading</h2>

    <p>
        This is a paragraph... I might introduce the rest of the page here.

        <br>
        <br>
        <br>

        Does HTML care about whitespace? No! That's why we use <br>
    </p>

    <h3>This is an even smaller subheading, giving the appearance of nested content.</h3>

    <p>4 &lt; 5</p>
    <p>HTML &amp; CSS</p>
    <p>Here is some &nbsp;text</p> <!-- as opposed to a <br> which will cause a wrap-->
        <!--
            Escape characters
                There are some characters that are used in and reserved
                for HTML code. If you want to use them in your content
                then you need to use their escape character equivalents.
                <       -   Less-than       &lt;        &#60;
                >       -   Greater-than    &gt;        &#61;    
                &       -   Ampersand       &amp;       
                ""      -   Quotations      &quot;
                        -   Space           &nbsp;

            <!--
            HTML tags/elements
            Used to indicate how content should be displayed...
            Usually they require an opening and a closing tag.  Those that do NOT require a closing tag
            are called self-closing tags.

                <p> paragraph
                <h#>    headings (range from 1-6, 1 being the largest)
                <div>   division/divider; used to group related elements together
                    ** The <span> tag is much like the <div> element, but <div> is a block-level element and <span> is an inline element.
                <img>   image (self-closing)
                <a>     anchor; used to create links to other webpages, or to sections of the current page
                <br>    line break (self-closing)
                <hr>    horizontal rule
                <input> creates a field for user input or some sort of [text, checkbox, etc.] (self-closing)
        -->
