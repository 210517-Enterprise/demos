            What's a scripting language?
                a snippet of code that automates some functionality.  It is NOT a complete applciation or program...it's just a snippet of code.


            What's JavaScript?
                JavaSciprt is a programming/scripting language originally designed to provide functionality to web pages.
                ; effectivelymaking those web pages more dynamic. it allows website clients to run code from their machines
                instead of always returning to a server for new information or calculations.

                Traditional languages like C++ are always compiled BEFORE they're run into executable binary form.  

                Scripting languages in contrast are executed line by line by an interpreter.

                Google Chrome's interpreter is called the V8 engine. Firefox is called Spider Monkey.
                In 2009, someone ripped out Chrome's V8 Engine and wrapped in a C++ shell, and thus Node was born,
                which allows you to execute javascript outside of the browser.

                Some feature os JS:
                    - It is Opbject Oriented
                    - Supports fucntional programming
                    - Loosely typed
                        - a variable can hold ANY datatype
                    - It's dynamic (you can control JS during runtime)
                        > you can modify the structure of objects while the program is running
                    - JS is designed for DOM manipulation
                        > The DOM Document Object Model is a virtual representation of the HTML page, rendered by the browser
                    - Generally JS is interpreted by 1 of 2 things: by the borwser, or node.js
