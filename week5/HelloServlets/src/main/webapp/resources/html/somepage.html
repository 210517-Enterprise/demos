	<h2>SuperVillain Servlets: Indirect Responses...</h2>

	<br /> <!--  This is an auto-closed tag -->

	<p>I call it luck. Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan. I've got to
		go home. It's late, I'm in for it as it is. As you wish. The more you
		tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through
		your fingers. Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've
		constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to
		the power of the Force. I can't get involved! I've got work to do!
		It's not that I like the Empire, I hate it, but there's nothing I can
		do about it right now. It's such a long way from here. A tremor in the
		Force. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master.
		What good is a reward if you ain't around to use it? Besides,
		attacking that battle station ain't my idea of courage. It's more
		likeâ€¦suicide. Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've
		constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to
		the power of the Force. I have traced the Rebel spies to her. Now she
		is my only link to finding their secret base. Don't be too proud of
		this technological terror you've constructed. The ability to destroy a
		planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force. Don't act so
		surprised, Your Highness. You weren't on any mercy mission this time.
		Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies. I want
		to know what happened to the plans they sent you.</p>
