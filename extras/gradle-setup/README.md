6. For `Variable name` type `GRADLE_HOME`.  

7. For `Variable value` click `Browse Directory` and select where your extracted `gradle-7.1.1` file was extracted.  *For example, if you extracted it as directed in step #2, the `Variable value` should be* `C:\Program Files\gradle-7.1.1`. Click `OK`.

8. Back in the `System variables` sections of your Environment Variables, find the **`Path`** variable. Click on this.

9. Edit the `Path` variable by clicking new, and paste the same value for the previously assigned GRADLE_HOME variable, but with `\bin` appended to it, *like so*: `C:\Program Files\gradle-7.1.1\bin`.  Click `OK`, and then `OK` 2 more times to exit and save your environment variables.
