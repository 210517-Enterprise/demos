# What is Enterprise Java?
Enterprise Java refers to Java applications written for enterprises.  That is, applications that can scale at large. 

The leading technology here is Java EE (Enterprise Edition) which consists of a set of APIs (EJB, JMS, JPA, JTA, JSF etc.) and the application servers (Glassfish, Tomcat, JBoss/WildFly etc.) which implement these APIs (or a part of them). 

Enterprise Java is not strictly restricted to Java EE; someone using Spring Framework for example is still an Enterprise Java programmer.
