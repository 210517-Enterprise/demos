	/*
	======== ArrayList ========
	
	Advantages
		
	+ It is not synchronized so it is fast.
	+ It works fast when we have to fetch or get the elements from the list.
	+ It maintains insertion order, means any element by default will be added in the end of arraylist.
	+ There can be duplicates in the arraylist.

	Disadvantages

	Never used Arraylist when you have to do lot of insertion and deletion as this will force arraylist 
	to adjust the elements present in the list instead used *LinkedList.
	When you want to add elements in the last or first and the arrayList size is 0, 
	in this case u can use linkedlist to add specifically on top and bottom of list.
	You can't maintain uniqueness.
	*/

	/*
	 *======= LinkedList =========
	 
	 A linked list is a common data structure made of a chain of nodes in which
	 each node contains a value and a pointer to the next node in the chain.
	  
	 The head pointer points to the first node, and the last element of the list
	 points to null. When the list is empty, the head pointer points to null.
	  
	 Insertion and deletion of nodes are really easier. Unlike array here we donâ€™t
	 have to shift elements after insertion or deletion of an element. In linked
	 list we just have to update the address present in next pointer of a node.
	  
	 TLDR, in ArrayList accessing an element takes constant time [O(1)] and adding
	 an element takes O(n) time [worst case]. 
	 In LinkedList adding an element
	 takes O(n) time and accessing also takes O(n) time but LinkedList uses more
	 memory than ArrayList.
