	/*
	 * Create a program using arrays that sorts a list of integers in DESCENDING order.
	 * Descending order is highest value to lowest.
	 * 
	 * In other words if the array had the values in it 106, 26, 81, 5, 15 your program should
	 * ultimately have an array with 106,81,26, 15, 5 in it.
	 * 
	 * Set up the program so that the numbers to sort are read in from the keyboard.
	 * 
	 * Implement the following methods - getIntegers, printArray, and sortIntegers
	 * 
	 * + getIntegers returns an array of entered integers from keyboard
	 * + printArray prints out the contents of the array
	 * + sortIntegers should sort the array and return a new array containing the sorted numbers
	 * 
	 * you will have to figure out how to copy the array elements from the passed array into a new
	 * array and sort them and return the new sorted array.
	 * 
	 * 
	 * Program execution is as follows: 
	 * 
	 * 		+ When I run the program, I am prompted to enter a certain amount of integers.
	 * 		+ Once I finish entering all my numbers, they are all printed to the screen IN DESCENDING ORDER because printArray() is called.
	 * 		+ The array that's passed through the printArray() method has been sorted in DESCENDING Order (e.g. 10, 9, 8, 7, 6).
	 * 
	 * Hint: I like to use boolean flags and while loops....
