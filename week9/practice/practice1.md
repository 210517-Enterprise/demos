> https://api.github.com/users/${login}

1. Fetch data with useEffect and load the data into a state variable.
2. Use JSX to render at least 5 properties from the data in the browser.
3. The component that is displaying the data must be in its own file, separate from App.js.
4. BONUS: Add a CSS stylesheet and style your component. 
5. BONUS: Add an input field so a user could search by a different username
