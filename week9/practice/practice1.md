> https://pokeapi.co

1. Fetch data with useEffect and load the data into a state variable.
2. Use JSX to render at least 6 properties from the data in the browser.
3. The component that is displaying the data must be in its own file, separate from App.js.
4. BONUS: Add a CSS stylesheet and style your component.
